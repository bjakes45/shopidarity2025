    	<h2>Why Now?</h2>
		<p>In an era marked by rising tariffs, global supply chain instability, and increasing economic isolation, communities are being pushed to adapt in real time. Products are harder to find, prices fluctuate wildly, and trust in centralized retail systems continues to erode.</p>
		<p>Shopidarity exists to counter this uncertainty.</p>
		<p>By building a cooperative product library rooted in shared knowledge and mutual aid, we're empowering people to find and share what they need locally â€” without being at the mercy of distant markets or opaque systems.</p>
		<p>This is a time for connection over competition, for shared resilience over isolated survival. When the shelves are empty and the rules keep changing, community sourcing isn't just a nice idea â€” it's essential.</p>
