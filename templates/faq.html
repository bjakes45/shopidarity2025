                <p class="mb-2">The Host will decide if the Collective Cart is publicly available, or only available to members of some of the groups they belong to.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Once the goal is reached, one big order is placed and the Host ensures that everyone recieves their share. Cash, e-transfer or other 3rd party payment systems are recommended for now. (*we are exploring the viability of hosting payments on our system, however that may incur a small fee to cover service costs which could limit potential savings)</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Participants and Hosts can then rate each other so that we can build a trust-based community of reliable folks that follow through on their promises.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Yes! Shopidarity began over a decade ago as an idea ahead of its time. Back then, the tools and user behaviors needed for collective shopping weren‚Äôt quite in place. Our team spent that time learning about community organizing and mutual aid best practices. This relaunch brings the concept into today‚Äôs contex. We are combining barcode scanning, social shopping habits, and a renewed interest in community-powered savings. The spirit is the same: use shared purchasing power to reward ethical brands and save money together.
