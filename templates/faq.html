            🌀 Is this a relaunch?
          </summary>
          <div class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Yes! Shopidarity began over a decade ago as an idea ahead of its time. Back then, the tools and user behaviors needed for collective shopping weren’t quite in place. Our team spent that time learning about community organizing and mutual aid best practices. This relaunch brings the concept into today’s contex. We are combining barcode scanning, social shopping habits, and a renewed interest in community-powered savings. The spirit is the same: use shared purchasing power to reward ethical brands and save money together.
